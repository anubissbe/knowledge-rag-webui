## Next Steps
1. Study Mem0's UI/UX design patterns
2. Create detailed requirements document
3. Design mockups and wireframes
4. Set up React/Vite project with TypeScript
5. Configure Tailwind CSS and component library

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite (upgraded)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Custom components (professional design)
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence (implemented)
- **Data Fetching**: Axios + TanStack Query (hybrid approach)
- **Graph Visualization**: D3.js (most flexible) - pending
- **Rich Text Editor**: @uiw/react-md-editor (implemented)
- **Search**: Multi-modal search (Hybrid/Vector/Fulltext)
- **Authentication**: JWT with auto-refresh and interceptors
- **Testing**: E2E testing with comprehensive scenarios

## API Endpoints to Integrate
- RAG Server: http://localhost:8002
- Knowledge Graph: http://localhost:8001
- Vector DB: http://localhost:8003
- Unified DB: http://localhost:8004

## Design Inspiration

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd /opt/projects/projects/knowledge-rag-webui
source /opt/projects/export-secrets.sh

# Start development
npm install
npm run dev

# Development commands
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript validation
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # Code linting

# Test backend services
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # RAG service
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Knowledge Graph
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # Vector DB
curl http://localhost:8004/health  # Unified DB
```

## Known Issues
- TypeScript compilation errors in some components (being addressed)
- Search interface needs backend integration testing
- Authentication flow requires complete implementation
- Mobile responsive design needs refinement
- Performance optimization for large result sets needed

## Questions/Decisions Pending
1. Should we use Shadcn/ui or build custom components?
2. WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events for real-time updates?
3. How to handle offline support effectively?
4. Authentication strategy (local vs OAuth providers)?
