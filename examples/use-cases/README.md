## üîç Search Examples

### Semantic Search
Find content by meaning, not just keywords:
- "machine learning concepts" ‚Üí finds ML-related content
- "team collaboration tools" ‚Üí discovers project management notes
- "debugging strategies" ‚Üí locates troubleshooting guides

### Entity-Based Search
Find related information through entities:
- Search for "React" ‚Üí shows all React-related memories
- Click on "TypeScript" entity ‚Üí reveals TypeScript connections
- Explore "Database" relationships ‚Üí discovers data architecture notes

### Collection Filtering
Organize search by context:
- Filter by "Work Projects" collection
- Search within "Learning Notes"
- Browse "Personal Ideas" category

## üìä Analytics Examples

### Knowledge Growth Tracking
Monitor your knowledge base expansion:
- Daily memory creation counts
- Tag usage patterns
- Collection growth over time
- Search frequency analysis

### Learning Insights
Understand your learning patterns:
- Most searched topics
- Knowledge connection density
- Concept mastery progression
- Review frequency optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Examples

### API Usage
Integrate with external tools:

```javascript
// Sync with note-taking apps
import { mcpAdapter } from './knowledge-rag-webui'

async function syncFromObsidian(notes) {
  for (const note of notes) {
    await mcpAdapter.memory.createMemory({
      title: note.title,
      content: note.content,
      tags: note.tags,
      metadata: { source: 'obsidian' }
    })
  }
}
```

### Automation Examples
Automate knowledge capture:

```bash
# Daily backup script
#!/bin/bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "backup_memories",
    "params": {
      "format": "json",
      "date": "'$(date +%Y-%m-%d)'"
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```
