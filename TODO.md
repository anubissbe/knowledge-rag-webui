## Completed Task Details

### Knowledge Graph Visualization (Completed 2025-06-19)
**Implementation Summary**:
- Created comprehensive D3.js-powered interactive graph visualization system
- Built three main components: GraphVisualization, GraphControls, and GraphSidebar
- Integrated with existing Zustand state management architecture

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **GraphVisualization Component**:
   - Force-directed layout with configurable physics simulation
   - Multiple layout algorithms: force, radial, tree, cluster
   - Interactive drag, zoom, and pan functionality
   - Node coloring by type (memory/entity/collection)
   - Dynamic node sizing based on connections
   - Real-time tooltips with detailed information
   - Mobile-responsive with touch support

2. **GraphControls Component**:
   - Layout switching between algorithms
   - Node coloring options (type, cluster, degree centrality)
   - Edge thickness controls
   - Label visibility toggles
   - Type-based filtering for nodes and edges
   - Minimum connections slider
   - Maximum depth control
   - Export functionality (JSON format)
   - Zoom controls and view reset

3. **GraphSidebar Component**:
   - Detailed node/edge information display
   - Memory preview with metadata
   - Entity relationship data
   - Collection statistics
   - Connected nodes navigation
   - Action buttons (view, edit, share)

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Type-safe TypeScript interfaces
   - GraphStore integration with Zustand
   - URL parameter support for deep linking
   - Proper loading states and error handling
   - Performance optimized for 1000+ nodes
   - Accessibility support with keyboard navigation

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚è≥
**Goal**: Get basic structure and core components working
**Timeline**: Week 1-2

Tasks:
- [x] Analyze Mem0 UI (Completed - Design doc created)
- [x] Setup React/Vite project (Completed - TypeScript + Tailwind configured)
- [ ] Design UI mockups
- [ ] Create base layout
- [ ] Build memory card component
- [ ] Create API client service

### Phase 2: Core Features üìù
**Goal**: Implement main functionality
**Timeline**: Week 3-4

Tasks:
- [ ] Memory list view
- [ ] Memory detail view
- [ ] Memory editor
- [ ] Search interface
- [ ] Search results
- [ ] State management

### Phase 3: User Experience üé®
**Goal**: Polish UI and add advanced features
**Timeline**: Week 5-6

Tasks:
- [ ] Collections management
- [ ] Knowledge graph visualization
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Theme system
- [ ] Mobile responsive design

### Phase 4: Production Ready üöÄ
**Goal**: Testing, optimization, and deployment
**Timeline**: Week 7-8

Tasks:
- [ ] Testing suite
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Accessibility features

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- **State**: Zustand
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Editor**: TipTap or Lexical
- **Graphs**: D3.js or Cytoscape.js

### Architecture Patterns
- Feature-based folder structure
- Container/Presentational components
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Service layer for API calls
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error boundaries

### Performance Goals
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive < 3s
- Lighthouse score > 90
- Bundle size < 200KB gzipped

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review Mem0 UI for inspiration
   - Set up development environment
   - Create initial React project
   - Design component architecture

2. **This Week**:
   - Complete foundation setup tasks
   - Create basic memory list view
   - Implement API client

3. **Questions to Resolve**:
   - Authentication method (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
   - Real-time update strategy (WebSocket vs SSE)
   - Graph visualization library choice
   - PWA vs standard web app
